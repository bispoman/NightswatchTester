# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This is a repositiry for the qa-test for Avenuecode. 

It was made with NightWatch, a Node.js based automated E2E testing solution.

I've ended up using only one testfile that should log in and then cover both test scenarios.

### How do I get set up? ###

For this to run you'll need to have NPM, Node v4.0 or newer, Google Chrome and Nightwatch.js.

In order to get NPM, you can visit this site: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

In order to get Node, you can visit this site: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

In order to get Google Chrome, you can visit this site: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html

And to get Nightwatch, you can visit this site: http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted#installation

If possible, install Nightwatch and Node as global, it makes everything a lot easier to run.

### How do I run the tests? ###

To run the tests, supposing you've installed the Nightwatch as global, you just need to run the command below on project's root folder:

>Nightwatch tests/avenue-tests.js --env chrome
